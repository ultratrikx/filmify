# Filmify

## Description
Filmify is a web application that uses [@sinanour](https://github.com/sinanonur/film-simulation)'s film emulation script to help make your normal photos look retro and aesthetic. This was a quick 1-hour ship that I made for the Boreal Express Hacakthon.

## Installation

Adjust the app.run() function in app.py to your desired host and port. Then run the following commands:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
